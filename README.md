# SSH-Ramdisk-Tool-Activation-IOS
Shell script will be finished and uploaded to public repository as soon as possible.
The fork of the warehouse can activate the mobile phone under SSH channel, and adapt to ios6-ios15.4. According to the automatic selection strategy of the system, the current version may not be stable, we will continue to develop and update.
Applicable to Checkm8 attack devices.
# How to use: 
directly put the script on the terminal to run, and the script will automatically activate the Apple device of the computer you link, which supports ios6-ios15 x. After activation, your screen will flash yellow and green alternately. If there is no change, it means that your device is not used in the environment where the SSH channel is opened. You can open the SSH channel first and then try it in the SSH channel opening tool developed by my dr238 team members. For the SSH system channel opening tool, please search dr238 in the search box for extraction.
Thank You.
